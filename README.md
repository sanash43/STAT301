# Group 34 : STAT301 Final Project

The housing market is a dynamic and complex system influenced by various factors, making accurate price prediction challenging yet crucial for both buyers and sellers. Understanding the relationships between the features of a house and its sale price can provide valuable insights into the market trends and aid in making informed decisions in domains such as the real estate market, government tax assessment, and insurance.

The dataset for this project is[House Sales in King County, USA](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction/code) from Kaggle. In this project, we will explore the predictive performance of different linear regression models to refine our understanding of the factors driving house sale prices in King County during 2014-2015.
